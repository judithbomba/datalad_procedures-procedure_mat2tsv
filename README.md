# procedure_mat2tsv

For mat2tsv.py to work, ```pandas``` and ```DataLad``` have to be installed.

The procedure is called by running ```datalad run-procedure mat2tsv.py <SOUCE OF .MAT FILES> <LOCATION FOR .TSV FILES>``` in the root dataset we want to operate on

TODO: test, why code sometimes only runs as procedure when called as ```mat2tsv.py```
